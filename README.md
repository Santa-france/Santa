# Santa 🌍 | Geoscientist & MSc Student

Hi! I'm a Santa, a Master’s student in Geology focusing on saltwater intrusion, coastal aquifers, and groundwater modeling. Originally from 🇰🇪 Kenya, currently living in 🇫🇷 France, where I’ve spent the past five years studying and working. I’m passionate about hydrogeology and coastal systems—especially saltwater intrusion and aquifer dynamics. My key interests include:

📊 Working with Excel for data analysis

🗺️ Mapping with QGIS

💧 Modeling groundwater with MODFLOW and SEAWAT

## 🪨 Projects
- **MODFLOW Simulation of the Roussilon plain Aquifer, France**  
  Modeled saltwater movement using USGS data + Python visualization tools.
